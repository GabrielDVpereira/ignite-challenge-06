This is an application crated from the challenge of the Ignite course that aims to put into practice concepts of NextJS + ChakraUi Library. 

## Libraries

 - Configuration: Some configuration that I used for this project includes: 
    - [husky](https://typicode.github.io/husky/#/?id=create-a-hook)
    - [lint-staged](https://github.com/okonet/lint-staged)
    - [eslint + prettier](https://www.google.com/search?q=eslint+and+prettier+next&oq=eslint+and+prettier+next&aqs=chrome..69i57j0i10i22i30j69i60.5963j0j4&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8)
    - [git-commit-msg-linter](https://www.npmjs.com/package/git-commit-msg-linter)

     The main goal is to ensure code pattern  
 - Ui: 
    - [ChakraUi](https://chakra-ui.com/)
    - [Swiper](https://swiperjs.com/react)

Needless to say, this project runs based on the concept of SSR by using [NextJS](https://nextjs.org/)
